Information about the uname command:

uname: By itself it will post the kernel name. 

uname -a: Will print all information about the machine in a specific order: kernel name, hostname, the kernel release, kernel version, machine hardware name, and operating system

uname -r: exact kernel release. Can be useful for finding exploits for that release.
