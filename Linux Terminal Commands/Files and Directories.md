Using the terminal is a quick and efficient way of editing files and directories. Here are some helpful commands:

# Touch
- `CrabSully@htb[/htb]$ touch <name>` creates a new, empty file with the name
- Handy for creating files of a specific type, such as a python file
- Can chain directory names like ./dir/subdir 

# mkdir
- Make a new directory
- `CrabSully@htb[/htb]$ mkdir <name>` is the command to create a new directory
# tree
- Shows the structure and contents of the selected directory
- `CrabSully@htb[/htb]$ tree .` will show the current directory, as '.' is short for the current directory
# mv 
- Moves files 
- `CrabSully@htb[/htb]$ mv <file/directory> <renamed file/directory>` is the syntax for moving it
- Selecting a file with the command, followed by a new file name will rename a file
