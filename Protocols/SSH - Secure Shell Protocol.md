SSH is a protocol that secures a connection between host and server. It encrypts user authentication, commands, output, and file transfers. SSH is useful for preventing Man-In-The-Middle attacks for that reason. It's an older protocol that uses little resources, which means it's extremely popular.

SSH Login:
```shell-session
CrabSully@htb[/htb]$ ssh [username]@[IP address]
```
